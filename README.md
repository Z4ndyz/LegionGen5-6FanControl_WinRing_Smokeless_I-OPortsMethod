# LegionGen5-6FanControl_WinRing_Smokeless_I-OPortsMethod
Method of controlling Fans on Lenovo Legions Gen 5/6

Make sure to run the app (.exe) as ADMIN otherwise IT WON'T WORK.
Make sure WinRing0x64.sys is not blocked from being used on your system otherwise the app
won't work.

Use the fan_config.txt files values near the .exe after building the sollution

This project was done in my free time wanting to move away from RwDrv.sys and using a driver
that is less prone to throw IRQL errors and BSODS.
Previously i used LFC (Legion Fan Control by Rodpad) before using a script to control
fans that was still using RwDrv.sys albeit in a more secure manner.
Huge thanks to SmokelessCPU for allowing me to share the files with you and of course by
exposing a way to make use of WinRing0x64.sys and I/O ports to write and read from the EC.

Huge thanks to @akillisandalye on Discord for helping me with EC mapping.

Disclaimer : Since i don't own a Legion Gen 5 i might not be able to bugfix it nor i'm
interested right now, someone could pick up this code and do said fixes.
Tested on my Legion Gen 6 Legion 5 Pro and it works flawlessly.

Fan Curves are checked and adjust themselves if needed every 15 seconds, if you build the source
yourself you can change the timer in main to a lower value.

You can set fan curves for Fn+Q modes as follow
Quiet Mode (1), Balanced Mode (2), and Performance and Custom mode (3/255) will share the same fan curve.
I could have separated them but i kept them the same curve since Legion Laptops do the same anyway.

Modify the value of legion_gen in the fan_config.txt files to corespond to your legion generation
5 or 6.

The other values in the config files i provided corespond to my fancurves

        # Number of points : 9

Disclaimer regarding fan config files

Do not use more than 9 points otherwise they'll be ignored and issues might be arised, I didn't
test that extensively. Using less points than 9 should be fine since i did some padding and checks
and it seemed ok but i didn't have the time nor energy to fully go throughly.

Second Disclaimer regarding fan config files
If the RPM values ar not in ascending order, or the ramp up and ramp down temps not abiding
to an ascending order too fan curves won't work properly. Please make sure to use the rpm
values in an ascending order and ramp up and ramp down values too. Also please make sure
to have each ramp up value paired with a ramp down value that is smaller than the one it's paired
with. Hopefully the config files i provided represent a clear example.

There are some binaries built already but it would be better if everyone compiled them themselves
because Windows might flag them.
You can find them at FanControl/FanControl/bin/Debug/net8.0

App was built with net8.0.
Files that should be present to have the App Running are

maybe ever so don't wait for it. ###
